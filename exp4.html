   <p> Web application development refers to the process of using client-side & server-side
    programming to develop an application that is accessible over the web browser.
    Web application development ranges from creating simple dynamic pages to
    complex social network applications and electronic business applications.
    The web application development process begins with the developer trying to find a
    solution to a specific problem, then designing the web app by choosing the
    appropriate development framework. Next, the developer tests the solution and<br>
    finally deploys the web app</p>
